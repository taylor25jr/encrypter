#  Description

Welcome and welcome to our first challenge!

During these four weeks, we will work on an application that encrypts texts, so you can exchange secret messages with other people who know the secret of the encryption used.

The encryption "keys" we will use are the following:

_The letter "e" is converted to "enter"_

_The letter "i" is converted to "imes"_

_The letter "a" is converted to "ai"_

_The letter "o" is converted to "ober"_

_The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"_

#  Requirements:

Should work with lowercase letters only
No letters with accents or special characters should be used
It should be possible to convert a word for the encrypted version also to return an encrypted word for its original version.
